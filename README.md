# SolarTracker

The main goal was to create a functional device both from a hardware (physical system) and software perspective, to perform tests that can prove the efficiency/improvement of solar energy capture, depending on the incidence of light rays on the photovoltaic cell.
The system aims to offer the user a simple and efficient way to use the solar energy captured by the PV cell for various uses, such as charging a battery or powering a device.
